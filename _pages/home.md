### What it **is**
Theorima film lab is a research project aimed at exploring new avenues of thought through the medium of the moving picture. 

No common thread ties together the films produced at theorima, except for the thinnest and loosest one--a strict adherence to a set of guiding axioms. 
If these axioms are to be stated, there is likely no better place to do it than right here:

* (*P1*) There are non-trivial truths of a contradictory nature. 
* (*P2*) Films are uniquely equipped to both express, question, and address these contradictory truths. 
* (*P3*) To articulate a contradiction is to open up a new way of thinking.

This is what theorima is, more or less[^1]. If either confusion or curiosity remains, please see [this]({% link _pages/profiles.md %}) page for inquiries and contact info. 


### What it is **not**
There are many things which theorima is *not*[^2]; most importantly theorima is **not** a laboratory for developing and processing film negatives. We kindly request folks to refrain from sending in camera negatives[^3].

#### Footnotes
[^1]: There's also blog posts, but that should just be taken as a given at this point. 
[^2]: Theorima is not, for example: *a building*, *an ideal*, *a 501(c)(3) non profit organization*, *a botany club*, *a theory of differentiable surfaces*, *a recipe for banana bread*, and so on. 
[^3]: Please be aware, due to lack of storage, any film negatives sent to our facilities will have to be disposed of within 2 weeks; negatives of *Eat, Pray, Love* will be disposed of immediately.
